# Django_Website
I developed this web application using Python Django Framework. To see the website visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/




URL Shortener Application Setup The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

$ cd URLShortener

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv django-env
$ django-Venv\Scripts\activate
Note the (django-env) in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal session operates in a virtual environment set up by virtualenv.

Once pip has finished downloading the dependencies:

(django-env)$ python manage.py runserver
And navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/
